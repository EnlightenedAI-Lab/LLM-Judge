# Enlightened AI Research Lab — Technical Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development trajectory for the Reflective Alignment Architecture (RAA), 
the Reflective Duality Layer (RDL), and the LLM Judge evaluation framework (L1–L7).  
It reflects both completed milestones and forward-looking priorities for 2025.

## 1. Completed Milestones (Q4 2024 – Q1 2025)

### Core Scientific Foundations
- Defined the **Reflective Alignment Architecture (RAA)** and its five foundational layers.
- Formalized the **Reflective Duality Layer (RDL)** and the principle of reflective coherence.
- Developed mathematical framing for coherence stability, perturbation response, and trajectory alignment.

### Documentation & Publications
- Released the initial whitepaper on **RAA & RDL**.
- Published the **Lexicon of Reflective Alignment** (v1.0).
- Created the first technical diagrams for RAA, Mirror-H, and reflective loops.

### Prototype Evaluation Framework
- Built **LLM Judge L2 Viewer** (Streamlit).
- Implemented paired forward+reflective prompt execution.
- Introduced early metrics: stability, divergence, signature profiles.
- Added JSONL test harness + results pipeline.

### Repository Infrastructure
- Established GitHub organization **Enlightened AI Lab**.
- Added license, contribution guidelines, funding page, and structured directories.
- Created documentation sections for evaluation, diagrams, and datasets.

## 2. Current Focus (Q1 2025)

### L3 Stability Viewer  
- Broader visualization of coherence-drift over sequential perturbations.  
- Signature clustering, collapse indicators, and rationalization patterns.  
- Global stability index (Ψ).

### RDL Formalization (Extended)
- Deep integration of RDL into multi-layer reasoning systems.
- Mapping forward vs reflective trajectories across long reasoning chains.
- Define the **Moral Coherence Index (MCI★)** and supporting diagnostics.

### Test Dataset Expansion  
- Expand test library to 500+ reflective prompts:
  - ethical ambiguity tests  
  - constraint-pressure tests  
  - temporal drift tests  
  - self-critique consistency chains  

### GitHub + Research Visibility  
- Public demos, diagrams, and explanatory documentation.
- Improved readability of all repos (L1–L7).

## 3. Mid-Term Goals (Q2 2025)

### L4–L5 Development
- **L4 Coherence Matrix**: Multi-dimensional coherence tensor across prompt families.
- **L5 Perturbation Engine**: Stress-testing across noise, contradictory conditions, temporal offsets.

### RAA Tooling
- Core RAA package with stable APIs.
- Integration of model adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, local inference).
- Reproducible benchmarks for reflective alignment.

### Dataset Publication
- Release of **Reflective Alignment Dataset v1** on Zenodo + HuggingFace.
- Accompanying annotation guidelines and evaluation scripts.

### Lexicon Expansion
- Grow the lexicon from ~300 entries to **1,500+**.
- Add cross-links, examples, mind-maps, and category-level diagrams.

## 4. Long-Term Vision (Q3 2025 – 2026)

### L6–L7 Instrumentation
- **L6 Reflective Oracle**: Meta-evaluation layer predicting instability before it emerges.  
- **L7 Alignment Monitor**: Continuous model-wide coherence tracking during training and deployment.

### Scientific Goals
- Establish reflective alignment as a measurable field parallel to interpretability.
- Formalize RDL as a mathematical model for moral intelligence emergence.
- Map rigidity, collapse, hallucination, and instability signatures across major LLMs.

### Ecosystem Impact
- Provide open-source tools to labs, safety teams, and researchers.
- Enable standardized evaluation of reflective coherence across the industry.
- Position Enlightened AI Research Lab as a leader in next-generation alignment science.
